## US companies and industry landscape with Crunchbase  Data 
### Overview
In order to get a better understanding of companies and industry landscape in US,  we analyzed companies distributions, funding amounts, and aquisition trends in US using the Crunchbase data. 
The [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/YuexiSC/data-visualization/blob/master/crunchbase_data_visualization/crunch_base_viz_final.ipynb) file consists of the following sections. The jupyter file is also available to view in [NBviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/YuexiSC/data-visualization/blob/master/crunchbase_data_visualization/crunch_base_viz_final.ipynb):

```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
% matplotlib inline
import warnings
from wordcloud import WordCloud
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

## Highlights 
The highlighted findings with plots from jupyter notebook are as follows: 
1. The number and distribution of US companies    
*The total number of companies in each state in US from 1960-2014*

2. Counts of companies founded and got acquired from year (2000 to 2013)        
*The trend of total companies founded and acquired over years.*  
>1.  Entrepreneurship is on an upward trend.  
>2.  Whether the crises have impacts on Entrepreneurship trend:   
>> 1) we can see that from 2007 to 2008 total companies founded remain constant, but no expected sharp decrease. And after financial crisis in 2008, there was a spike of total companies founded, kind of an economic revival, but the acquisition activities kept constant after financial crisis.      
>> 2) However, after crisis of 2012, the Containing Crisis, the total companies founded had a sharp decrease. We can tell the Containing Crisis that countries and banks struggle to get balances sheets has much negative impact on starting a company. In the contrast, acquisition activities increased slightly.   

So, we can tell from this plot, that crisis do have some impacts on total companies founded and acquired each year, but the most famous 2008 financial crisis actually didnâ€™t affect much on total companies founded and acquired.
